# odin-recipes
This project is a recipe website, containing three of my favorites things to cook and bake.
Since this is my first website building project, I had to face a few challenges:
1. I tried to better my committing comments in order to be more professional.
2. Using the git commend line prompts was a bit challenging at times, since i kept forgetting parts of the commends.
3. A few typos in file names led to an annoying process of changing file names and re-committing them.
